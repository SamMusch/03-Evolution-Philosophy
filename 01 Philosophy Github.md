# My conclusions

Process of evolution

1. Begin with a set of circumstances.

2. Optimize **short-run** behavior.

3. Circumstances change as a result.

4. Rinse & repeat.

5. Result: Cycles (ie lagging corrections) with a **long-run equilibrium**.

   Eventually, some new shock or technology is introduced that changes the course of the **long-run equilibrium**.

Morality 

1. **Circumstance:** Homo sapiens are physically "weak" compared to other apex predators.

2. **Adapt**: We develop consciousness and form together into societies for safety.

3. **Circumstance:** Societies offer protection, but add the risk of internal attacks (eg stealing).

4. **Adapt:** We develop reason. "Even though its best for me **right now** to steal, I'll be worse off in the **long-run** because people will steal from me."

   We formalize these understandings into laws and remove those who disobey from the society. Being physically weak **forced** us to develop consciousness, reason, and ultimately morality.

Agriculture societies

1. As the earth warms, northern Africa / western Arabia change from savannah to desert.
2. Hunter-gatherers in the region migrate north 
3. Begins with a small society of hunter-gatherers. 
4. Specialize roles for each individual family.
5. Keep the city in the middle, but spread families out to their own land.
   1. Property rights, contracts
6. Meet in the city to trade.
7. More people trading = greater number of goods available = higher standards of living
8. This economy naturally looks *outward* for new countries / people to trade with.

[Timeline with Eons, Eras, Periods](https://natmus.humboldt.edu/exhibits/life-through-time/visual-timeline)

**Pangea** existed between about 299 million years ago (at the start of the Permian Period of geological time) to about 180 million years ago (during the Jurassic Period). It remained in its fully assembled state for some 100 million years before it began to break up.

Names: Originally thought that life began **after** the precambrian.

1. **Precambrian**: Cambria = Roman name for Wales
2. **Phanerozoic** = Life
   1. **Paleozoic**: Visible life
   2. **Mesozoic**: Middle life
   3. **Cenozoic**: Recent life

General trend is that the Earth is **COOLING**

1. Paleogene

   1. Paleocene (65 Mya)
      - Small animals and birds
      - India collides with Asia

   2. Eocene (55 Mya)
      - Herbivores feed on leaves and herbs, no grass yet
      - Carnivores: dog, weasel, bear and cat families
   3. Oligocene (34 Mya)
      - Global cooling: Forests shrink, grasslands expand
      - First **Anthropoidea** (humans, monkeys, apes)

2. Neogene

   1. Miocene (23 Mya) - [PBS Eons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HooZ84rpovQ&t=290s)

      - Begin with short period of global warming

      - Grasslands across Northern Hemisphere

      - Messinian Salinity Crisis (6.2 - 5.6 Mya) (aka MSC)

        Repeating erosion events & Milankovitch climate cycles cause the Mediterranean Sea to dry up. The sea then refills quickly during the **Zanchlean Flood**.

   2. Pliocene (5 Mya)

      - Bridge forms between North and South America
        - North: Sloths, armadillos, marsupials
        - South: Cats, dogs
      - First hominids in Africa
        - **Lucy - Australopithecus afarensis - 3.7 Mya**

   3. Pleistocene (2 Mya)

      - 20 cycles of glaciations
      - Modern humans

   4. Holocene (11.5 Kya)

[PBS Eons: When the Sahara was Green](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQP-7BPvvq0)

**African Humid Period**: Northern Africa was much wetter

- Start: ~50 and 11 kya

- End: 5 kya 

- Evidence: The pollen in deep-sea sediment off the coast of Mauritania from older periods matches the pollen today. 

  Desert sediement: Grasses, sedges

  Savanna: Ephedra

**Neanderals**: Common ancestor with humans 660k years ago, interbreeding 45-80k years ago

Savanna Hypothesis: Humans were **forced** out of the trees, developed walking upright as a result

Aridity Hypothesis: Savanna was expanding

- Green = agriculture
- Brown = uninhabitable

Lateralization = cognitive processes tend to be on one side of the brain

- Abnormalites
- Left or mixed-handedness, footedness, and eye dominance
- Course of schizo sees disruptions in lateralization



[Paper from 2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4471966/)

Terms

- **Phenomenological**: subjective experience, what is it like to have this?
- **Aberrant salience**: dopamine not being transferred right

Neurocognitive

- 2 Domains
  1. Phenom
     1. Minimal-self or ipseity disturbance
     2. Hyperreflexivity/alienation
  2. Neurocog
     1. Aberrant salience
     2. Prediction error
- Issues
  - Consistency of results
  - Overly homogenize, over simplify
  - Can phenomenology give more testable hypotheses?

### Depression

Emotions come from the limbic system (old brain). Our old brain generate <u>negative emotions</u> when anything from [Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs](https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Maslow-graphic-e1554903616963.png) is threatened.

- **Problem**: Emotions only provide a signal that something is wrong. Our brains need <u>structure</u> to make positive decisions. 
- **Solution**: Write, vent, or go to therapy. Force these <u>negative emotions</u> into a <u>structure</u> to understand what's wrong.



[Paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3181986/)

Evolutionary memories of such importance were coded into the 

- genome in rough form (as primary brain processes)
- these are refined by basic learning mechanisms (secondary processes) as well as by 
- higher-order cognitions/thoughts (tertiary processes)



Neural nature of of emotions

- Overactive panic/grief networks
- Diminished seeking networks



Levels of control 

1. Primary processes (sub-neocortical)
   1. Emotional affects
   2. Homeostatic affects
   3. Sensory affects
2. Secondary processes (basal ganglia)
   1. Classical conditioning
   2. Instrumental and operant conditioning
   3. Emotional habits
3. Third - Neocortical "awareness" function (cerebral cortex)
   1. Cognitive executive functions: thoughts and planning
   2. Emotional deep thoughts
   3. Free will

- Stories refer to the Mycenaen people from before the collapse.
- The *Iliad* and *Odyssey* refer to the 10 year journey home after they have destroyed the city of Troy.
- Creates a positive shared identity for Greeks, also leads to viewing non-Greeks of speaking "ba-ba" baby nonsense. Troy was seen as basically the same people as the Greeks. Persians (Iran) and Egypt were thought of highly.

### 1000 - 100 BC Israel

Ch 2 - A People and Their Land

Children of Israel = Hebrews = "Habiru"

Patriarchs: Starts with Abraham around 1800 BC

Israel (Canaan)

- Connects Egypt to Iraq (Abraham came from Ur which is in Iraq)
- Jews = Judah = Judaea = "Promised" Land
- Christians --> Jesus born here = "Holy" Land
- Abraham --> Isaac --> Jacob. Jacob ends up wrestling with someone who renames Jacob as "Israel"

8th and 7th BCE prophets such as Jeremiah, Hosea, Isaiah do not include stories of Israel / the Patriarchs. These stories do not begin until the 6th century. This implies the Patriarchs might post-date the 7th century BCE.

Bible marks the great flood at 2348 BC (4.2 kiloyear event). If we shift 1200 years, we arrive near 1200 BC (Bronze Age collapse)

Pentateuch = first five books = 'five scrolls'

Exodus occurs in ..?

Book of Judges occurs 1200-1050 BCE. Philistines = Palestine

Matthew & Luke say Jesus was born in Bethlehem (Judea) (Prophet Micah said He would be born here). The other 3 gospels refer to Jesus as coming from Nazareth (Galilee). Luke's ancestor list of Jesus is men, but Matthew's are non-Jewish women with the exception of Mary.

Isaiah's prophecy said that the Messiah would be born of a "young women", not specifically a virgin. This was translated into the Greek word for virgin (*parthenos*).

# Philosophy

[Branches](http://www2.hawaii.edu/~freeman/courses/phil100/02.%20Branches%20or%20Areas%20of%20Philosophy.pdf)

## Metaphysics

What is the relationship between mental properties and physical properties?

Humans have

- physical properties
- mental properties (consciousness, perceptual experience)
- intentionality (beliefs, desires)



Mind body problem breaks down into

1. Ontological question
   1. what are mental states? what are physical states? are they distinct, or does one depend on the other?
2. Causal question
   1. do physical states influence mental states? Do mental states influence physical states? If so, how?
3. The problem of consciousness: 
   1. what is consciousness? How is it related to the brain and the body?
4. The problem of intentionality: 
   1. what is intentionality? How is it related to the brain and the body?
5. The problem of the self: 
   1. what is the self? How is it related to the brain and the body?
6. The problem of embodiment: 
   1. what is it for the mind to be housed in a body? What is it for a body to belong to a particular subject?



## Dennett: Bact to Bach

### 1 Intro

Why are there minds? And how do we know there are minds?

- Evolution + tools
  - Tools: Speaking, reading, writing, math, navigation, compass, telescope 



3 arguments

- Turning our world upside down (Darwin and Turing)
- Evolving evolution into intelligent design
- Turning our minds inside out



Bio (pg 6-12)

- 1st 2 billion: prepping for life. Energy, reproduction, prokaryotes
- 1st technology transfer: 1 prok engulfs another prok but lets it live. When the prok reproduced (ie splits in half), its fitter than its competition
- Speciation: members become isolated from their parents & form a new gene pool
- 3 factors of life: Population, technology, intelligence



Rene Descartes (pg 13-22)

- I think, therefore I am
- Dualism: mind & matter. Problem: How do these interact?
- Dennett: Don't get pulled back into Cartesian gravity (but I *must* have a mind)
- Cartesian (1st person) vs  scientists (3rd person)



# Christianity

[Stanford](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-arguments-god/#GoaTheArg)
[Bible Data](https://viz.bible/bible-data/)

"Jesus drew from teachings of Greece and Israel"

- Hebrew Yeshua = Greek Jesus
- Hebrew Messiah = Greek Christos

## New Testament

[Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaucATa9ufQ)

Gospel means "good news" - story of Jesus

Each were put together their own theological points. Purpose was not to give a historical perspective.

**Matthew** - Close follower of Jesus

- Jesus = King of the Jews
- Emphasize teachings of Jesus, how his teachings intersect with Old Testament
- Jesus fulfills word of the Law + Prophets

---

**Mark** - Was not a close follower of Jesus, took notes from Peter

- Jesus = Suffers on behalf of us
- Emphasis on Jesus authority and being son of God
- Likely a source for Matthew and Luke



**Luke** - Gentile, wrote to put together a biography for his friend

- Jesus = Savior of all people
- Events are in chronological order
- Acts is the sequal to Luke



**John** - material is unique, won't be found in other parts of the New Testament

- Jesus = God
- Focuses on miracles and significant statements that Jesus made
- Meant to persuade non-believers

---

## Islam

622-1500

Christianity and Judaism  are divided against each other. Both do not like the other religions in the area.

Arabia had seen lots of success historically, but there was a dam failure at Marib and the society was dying.

Caliph after Muhammed ('Abd al-Malik): "It is a power that was established by the sword and not a faith confirmed by divine miracles, like Christianity and like the old law of Moses."

"To begin with, Muhammed had his followers pray facing Jerusalem, and he only altered the direction of prayers to Mecca after a murderous disagreement with the Jews of Medina."

"As revelations continued, [Muhammed] would dictate the words he had heard to an ever growing body of disciples, through years of struggle in which he and his followers (Muslims) saw their fortunes transformed. At first they were a beleaguered group suffering oppresion and expulsion - their moment of withdrawal ('Hijra') from Mecca to Yathrib (Medina) in 622 has become the basis of Islamic dating."

## Book: Reason for God

**The Clues of God**

*Intro*

 A brilliant young scientist looks at many arguments for God. The scientist felt that every one had some evidence that was rationally avoidable by others. 

- Author response: You are assuming "strong rationalism", but Chrisitianity requires faith. Also, instead of trying to find airtight "proof", look at the evidence cumulatively as a clue for the existence of God.
- My issue with the author: A collection of weak arguments is not the same as a strong one.

---

1. The Mysterious Bang

Note: The author is not providing evidence for Christianity. He is starting from a place of Christianity as the default, posing potential atheist arguments, then casting a shadow of doubt on them.

Francis Collins argument:

- 15B years ago was the first time we had "something". 

- This implies that, before this, there was "nothing". 

- This implies that someone "started" the universe. Otherwise, how could the universe create itself from nothing?


Author argument:

- Everything we know in this world is contingent on other things outside of itself.

- The universe is a collection of such contingent entities.

- Therefore, the universe must be contingent on something else.

  My issue: He's drawing equalivants in the *words* being used, but these relationships don't necessarily exist in nature. He's also taking the same restrictions for things inside the universe and applying them to the universe as an entity itself.



2. Cosmic Welcome Mat

- The probability of the physics stuff coming together in the way it did is statistically negligible. There are 15 constants required - any of them being off by 1/millionth, our universe would not have occured

- Therefore, its more likely that there was someone who "fine-tuned" things. Additionally, does it really make sense based on if the tiny chance is actually true?

  - Stephen Hawking agrees

  My issue: He's making it seem like its either Christianity or atheism, and atheisms odds are tied to the tiny number.



3. Regularity of Nature

- We have no justification for believing that the future has been like the past. We must just take it on faith. And isn't that what Christians do anyway?

  - Author says that many scholars think modern science came from Christian civilizations - God sustains an orderly universe

  My issue: Not fully understanding something is not a good enough reason to believe in God. Lack of answers does not indicate that there is a God, just that humans haven't figured it out / aren't capable of understanding.



4. The Clue of Beauty

- If there is no God, then everything in the world is just a combination of atoms and there is no purpose to anything. This includes beauty and love.

- In contrast, we feel and long and things like love.

  - The appetite for food proves that food exists.
  - Then, the longing for meaning suggests that there is meaning.

  My issue: Being able to imagine something does not imply that it exists.



5. The Clue Killer

- Everything about us as humans is a by-product of natural selection. This includes our ability to use reason. 
- However, natural selection would lead our reasoning to be whatever helps us survive. It does not lead to actually uncovering the truth.
- If the brains of atheists can't be trusted to capture reality, why should we listen to them at all?



6. The Clue-Killer is Really a Clue

- If there is no God, than you would not expect to see things like love / beauty. You also wouldn't trust your brain, or that the sun will rise tomorrow.
- In contrast, we do. The world that we would expect to see from the Big Bang differs from what we do actually see.



## Genesis

### Summary

[Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOUV7mWDI34)

Ch 1-11: Tells the story of God & the whole world

When Adam & Eve ate from the tree of good & evil, they gained their own moral values. Adam & Eve's definitions might be different from each other, so they feel shame and hide from each other.

Lamech collects wives like property and brags that he is more vengeful than Cain ever was. God decides to wipe us out with the flood. People decide to build the tower of Babel, but God scatters them.
